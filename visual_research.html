							<h2>Creating a Visually Appealing Application</h2>
						</header>
						<p>There are many things to consider whilst creating an application. These things include: 
							the color palette, typography, icons, names & logos, and microinteractions & animations. 
							Before selecting the style of these elements, an inspiration board was created to learn about
							 similar fitness/nutrition and marketplace applications currently present.</p>
						<hr />
						<h3>Inspiration Board</h3>
						<p>The inspiration board illustrates several apps that we’ve drawn inspiration from for the mockup and 
							prototyping of iFit. Since iFit is a combination of fitness and a marketplace, we thought that seeking
							 inspiration from apps in these domains would be fitting. Robinhood is a popular stock trading app 
							 that is widely used by many people. It’s color palette and visual data representation are fitting 
							 for a stock trading app, and so it inspired the design of iFit. 
						</p>

						<p></br>
							Within the last 3-5 years, the Dark mode feature has become more and more popular as major companies 
							have begun rolling out this feature to cater to night users by limiting eye strain. Not only this, 
							Dark mode provides a number of benefits including improved readability of text, clearer contrast, 
							reduced eye fatigue, reduced Blue Light etc. We wanted our customers to benefit from all of these 
							advantages and this inspired our decision making when deciding on which color palette to use. 
						</p>
						<div style="text-align:center">

						</div>
						<p></br>
							Stacked Card UI design has gained mainstream status in the modern world of interface design and is seen 
							in more and more apps every day. Because we aim to provide a familiarized and comfortable experience for 
							our users, we chose this style. This design gives a more personalized user experience by 
							providing a balanced, simple and aesthetically pleasing look. We took inspiration from the stacked card 
							design on the Samsung Health app.
						</p>
						<div style="text-align:center">
							<img class="health_img" src="images/samsung health.jpg" alt=""/>
						</div>
						<hr />
						<h3>Color Palette</h3>
						<p>
							The color red symbolizes health, blood, the heart, love. Red is an emotionally intense
							 color. A red color palette is fitting for a fitness/health application. As seen in the
							  inspiration board, the Apple Health app opted for a red color palette. However, we 
							  believe that green is more suitable as a color palette. Green symbolizes life, health,
							   and money. We feel that green is a better choice since it represents our overall 
							   application better (both the fitness and market domains). Additionally, black will 
							   be used as a secondary/background color as it contrasts well with the green color 
							   palette and provides us with the dark mode benefits mentionned previously. The color green will 
							   be used as an accent color which will contrast with the overall black background color. The text 
							   font will be a white and grey colour since we found this combination to be the most optimal in 
							   reducing eye strain and ensuring conciseness and clarity.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align:center"><img class="palette_img" src="images/visual_research/colorpalette.png" alt="" /></p>
						
						<hr />
						<h3>Typography</h3>
						<p>
							Open Sans is a free Google Font that will be used for this application. The sans-serif typeface 
							is well suited for a marketplace application. It is a simple and clean font that will 
							complement the application.
						</p>
						<div>
							<img class="persona_img" src="images/visual_research/typography.png" alt="" />
						</div>
						<hr />
						<h3>Iteration</h3>
						<p>
							Our first few mock-ups had a light green color as the primary background color, with a white
							 secondary and text color. We scrapped this design because we felt that the bright 
							 green was too colorful and unprofessional. After seeking inspiration from other apps, 
							 we saw that there is a trend towards darker themed apps. Our final decision was to go 
							 for a dark background with green accents to complement it. This proved to be a better 
							 design as it made the overall application seem more professional, and the contrast helped 
							 with reading text, viewing buttons and visualizing the data.
