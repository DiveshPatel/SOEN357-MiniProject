						<h3>Our journey throughout development</h3>
						<p>
							Designing and developing iFit has been such an amazing journey for our team. Since our inception, 
							we have always focused on delivering innovation that makes your life better. We attach the upmost 
							importance to our customer's growth and ensure our products provide the tools necessary to achieve it. 
							Our goal with this product was to promote a healthy and active life for society by sharing their fitness data.
						</p> </n>
						<p>
							The major challenge with this application was the user’s consent. The majority of people that we surveyed 
							already knew that major companies like Facebook and Amazon, collect their personal data after they use their 
							platform and sell it for revenue.  Most of these people were not comfortable with this fact. Therefore, we 
							had to provide an incentive to our customers to share their data while maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.
						</p> </n>
						<p>
							We asked you what you wanted, and you delivered. You let us know that you’d be willing to sell your fitness data 
							if you were paid for it with minimal effort. Most importantly you let us know the world should not be profiting 
							from your personal information while you receive nothing for your services.
						</p> </n>
						<p>
							We listened and we decided to provide a platform where you can profit from the sales of your personal statistics. 
							Thus, iFit came into existence. Your data is valuable, and we know it’s worth.
						</p>
						<h3>What do we have planned for the future?</h3>
						<p>
							We are constantly working on new features. Our current plans include adding measurements for blood content levels 
							such as sugar and cholesterol. Subscribe to our newsletter to receive updates on what we are building and have 
							your say in the topic. Your voice matters and we are here to listen to it.
						</p>
						<h3>Our Message</h3>
						<p>
							For the first time in the history of mankind, there are more people in this world that are overweight than those 
							that are under. We are eating more calories than ever before and working less to burn those calories. Due to our 
							sedentary lifestyles, obesity rates have soared.The fact is that the only way to remain healthy is to remain active 
							while maintaining a healthy and sustainable diet.
						</p> </n>
						<p>
							We at iFit hope that this application will promote to transition into your fitness lifestyle. We are an
							organization that is committed to your personal development and success. Our belief is that each day is a new 
							opportunity to improve yourself, you need to take it and make the most of it.
						</p> </n>
						<p> Stay healthy, remain and most importantly be happy!</p>
